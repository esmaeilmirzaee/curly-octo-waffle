# TypeScript, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL

> In this repository, I have just developed a simple CRUD operations using `TypeScript`, `Express`, `Sequelize`, and `Postgresql`.

It is worth noting that I user Postgres in a container so I could deploy my application in the future easily. And, I use visual studio code as my primary coding environment.

I know it is against best practice to work on `main`/`master` branch but to make everything smooth and simple I just use the `main` branch.

```bash
mkdir project_name
npm init -y

npm i -S

npm i -S -D

npx tsc --init

mkdir src
touch src/app.ts
code .
```
